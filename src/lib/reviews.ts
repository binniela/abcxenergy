/**
 * Product reviews registry.
 *
 * IMPORTANT — populate ONLY with real, consented customer reviews. Keyed by
 * SKU id first, then by series slug as a fallback so a review can apply to a
 * whole series. While a product has no real reviews it shows a "no reviews yet"
 * state and emits NO AggregateRating: fabricated ratings violate FTC endorsement
 * rules and Google's review-snippet policy, and risk manual action. Add genuine
 * reviews here and the star summary + Product/AggregateRating schema activate
 * automatically.
 *
 * Example entry:
 *   "sku-brz-09": [
 *     { author: "Marcos R.", role: "Installer", rating: 5, date: "2026-05-02",
 *       location: "Fremont, CA", verified: true,
 *       title: "Quiet and quick to commission",
 *       body: "Paired cleanly, refrigerant charge was spot on…" },
